# react-portfolio

## Description
- The goal of this project was create a portfolio website that has a navigation system, is cut into three distinct sections, and contains an interactive portfolio image grid. 

- I built this project in order to better understand how to put my recently acquired flexbot skills to the test, and to attempt to build out a full website page from scratch. 

- What I learned on this project is that it is difficult to adjust flexbot parameters if you do not know the proper workflow for integrating external elements like mouse over and text overlay. I had a great deal of issue with getting a text overlay on top of my image grid, and was ultimately unsuccessful. I learned a great deal about rows and columns in this website development, and how they have uses outside of the normal grid system used for images.
